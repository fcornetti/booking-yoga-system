## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+

### Backend Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the backend server:

```bash
python app.py
```

3. The server will typically start on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`

### Frontend Setup

No build tools required—just open `index.html` in your browser.

To connect to the backend, update the `API_URL` value inside the `<script>` section of `index.html`:

```js
const API_URL = 'http://127.0.0.1:5000'; // or your deployed backend URL
```
