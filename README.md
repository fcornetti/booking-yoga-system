Codeoubts:
1. ~~Why do i have to specify Booking id in line 201?~~
2. ~~Do we build the logic~~ (e.g. just show classes in the future) ~~in the backend or in the frontend?~~ 
3. Rewrite /classes/bookings from query to dict 
4. Should i move the logic = build the group by in the frontend and keep in the backend only GET classes? @lwang
